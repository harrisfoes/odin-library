## Requirements

## Dev Breakdown

[x] adding new objects into an array
[x] attaching listener to dynamically created buttons

[x] learn about bubbling
[x] check event when bubbling

[x] use method to change read status
[x] finish read functionality
[x] overall program flow

## Thoughts
The biggest challenge for this is the dynamically created buttons. The biggest bugs had to do with propagation and array.slice manipulation, which I had then fixed by using array.filter. 
I managed to finish this project in 2 and a half days with around 4-5 hours of concentrated work per day.
Overall I enjoyed it.
