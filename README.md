## Thoughts
The biggest challenge for this is the dynamically created buttons. The bugs had to do with propagation and array.slice manipulation, which I had then fixed by using array.filter. 
I managed to finish this project in 2 and a half days with around 4-5 hours of concentrated work per day.
Overall I enjoyed it.

# Update
Refactored code to make it a class implementation
Ran into a few bugs that stumped me but I was able to fix it after taking a break (who knew that worked?)
Wiped my first rewrite of the code due to mishandling of git branch but recovered it fairly quickly
